# QlabRemote
Qlab Remote Surface with built-in MTC Reader
It is a remote control specifically designed for Qlab, inspired by the Q widget I own, but whose LEDs are very bright. Since I didn't want to modify mine, I decided to make my own and learn a bit about microcontroller programming and 3D CAD design at the same time.
Especially in rehearsals it is important for the stage manager to keep track of the timecode, but for her the frames are distracting and the hours are irrelevant. So the MTC reader function in minutes and seconds only is a must, as it does not exist, so I decided to make my own.
The buttons have coloured LEDs, which can be adjusted in brightness and are set to 50% of the user-set brightness when idle and 100% with a short flash when pressed.
An encoder with a push button to arm and navigate through the list of cues.

I'm using Github's Copilot for this and will soon list all the resources that have helped me in this process.
